### Task 1: Sample Question and Answer

#### Question:

You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.

The chart below shows the number of international students enrolled in Australian universities from 2000 to 2020. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

Write at least 150 words.

*(Assume this is a line chart showing an increasing trend over the years.)*

#### Answer:

The line chart illustrates the number of international students enrolled in Australian universities from 2000 to 2020. Overall, the data indicates a significant upward trend in the number of international students over the two-decade period.

In 2000, the number of international students stood at approximately 100,000. This figure rose steadily over the next ten years, reaching about 250,000 in 2010. The most substantial growth occurred between 2010 and 2015, where the numbers surged from 250,000 to 400,000. From 2015 onwards, the growth rate slightly decelerated, but the trend remained upward, culminating in around 500,000 international students by 2020.

A notable point of comparison is the period between 2000 and 2010, which experienced a moderate increase, whereas the subsequent decade saw more rapid growth. This could be attributed to various factors such as enhanced global recognition of Australian universities and increased international recruitment efforts.

In conclusion, the chart clearly demonstrates a robust and continuous increase in the enrollment of international students in Australian universities over the 20-year span, reflecting Australia's growing appeal as a destination for higher education.

### Task 2: Sample Question and Answer

#### Question:

You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.

Write about the following topic:

Some people believe that academic subjects such as history and physics should be prioritized over practical subjects like cooking and carpentry in school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.

#### Answer:

There is an ongoing debate about whether academic subjects such as history and physics should be prioritized over practical subjects like cooking and carpentry in school curricula. While academic subjects are undeniably important, I believe that practical subjects should also hold a significant place in the education system.

Firstly, academic subjects provide students with essential knowledge and critical thinking skills. For instance, history teaches students about the past, fostering an understanding of how societies evolve, while physics helps develop analytical skills and an understanding of the natural world. These subjects are fundamental in preparing students for higher education and a range of professional careers, contributing to their intellectual development.

However, practical subjects offer equally valuable benefits. Cooking and carpentry, for example, teach essential life skills that are often overlooked in traditional academic education. Cooking not only promotes healthy living but also encourages creativity and cultural appreciation. Carpentry, on the other hand, develops manual dexterity, problem-solving skills, and a sense of accomplishment from creating tangible objects. These skills are crucial for personal development and can also lead to viable career opportunities in trades that are always in demand.

Moreover, integrating practical subjects into the curriculum can enhance student engagement and cater to diverse learning styles. Not all students excel in traditional academic subjects; some may have a natural aptitude for practical tasks. Providing a balanced education that includes both academic and practical subjects ensures that all students have the opportunity to discover and develop their strengths.

In conclusion, while academic subjects are essential for intellectual growth and career preparation, practical subjects play a crucial role in equipping students with life skills and engaging different learning preferences. Therefore, schools should strive to balance both types of education, ensuring a well-rounded and inclusive approach to student development.
