Task 1: Tips and Tricks
-----------------------

### Understand the Data

1.  **Analyze the Visuals**: Spend a few minutes examining the graph, chart, table, or diagram. Identify key trends, significant changes, and notable comparisons.
2.  **Identify Key Information**: Focus on the most important data points and trends that you need to describe.

### Structure Your Response

1.  **Introduction**: Paraphrase the question and state what the graph/chart/table/diagram shows. For example:

    -   "The line graph illustrates the number of people using public transportation in a city from 2000 to 2020."
    -   "The bar chart compares the sales figures of four different products over a five-year period."
2.  **Overview**: Summarize the main trends or significant features without going into too much detail. This gives the reader a quick understanding of the data. For example:

    -   "Overall, there was a significant increase in the number of people using public transportation over the 20-year period."
    -   "The sales of product A and B showed a steady rise, while product C experienced a decline."
3.  **Details**: Provide specific details and data points to support your overview. Use comparative language and mention notable changes. For example:

    -   "In 2000, the number of people using public transportation was 20,000. This figure rose gradually to 50,000 by 2010 and reached a peak of 80,000 in 2020."
    -   "Product A sales increased from 10,000 units in 2015 to 30,000 units in 2020, while product C sales dropped from 20,000 units to 10,000 units over the same period."

### Use Appropriate Language

1.  **Comparative Language**: Use words and phrases that show comparison and contrast (e.g., higher than, lower than, as much as, whereas).
2.  **Linking Words**: Connect ideas with linking words (e.g., however, therefore, in contrast, moreover).

### Be Concise

1.  **Stay Relevant**: Focus on the most important information and avoid unnecessary details.
2.  **Meet the Word Count**: Ensure you write at least 150 words.

Task 2: Tips and Tricks
-----------------------

### Understand the Prompt

1.  **Identify the Task**: Carefully read the question to determine the main topic and the specific task (e.g., discuss both views, agree/disagree, advantages/disadvantages).
2.  **Brainstorm Ideas**: Spend a few minutes thinking about your response and planning your essay.

### Structure Your Essay

1.  **Introduction**: Paraphrase the question, present your thesis statement, and outline the main points. For example:

    -   "Many people believe that universities should focus on providing students with practical skills for their future careers, while others argue that the primary aim of higher education should be to impart theoretical knowledge. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my opinion."
2.  **Body Paragraphs**:

    -   **Paragraph 1**: Present the first main idea, support it with examples and explanations. Use linking words to ensure coherence.

        -   "On the one hand, practical skills are essential for employment. Employers often seek candidates who can immediately contribute to the workplace, which practical training facilitates. For example, medical students who participate in internships are better prepared for their careers as doctors."
    -   **Paragraph 2**: Present the second main idea, support it with examples and explanations. Address potential counterarguments.

        -   "On the other hand, theoretical knowledge provides a foundation for innovation and critical thinking. Academic subjects such as philosophy and pure sciences foster a deeper understanding of the world and encourage intellectual development. For instance, theoretical research in physics has led to groundbreaking advancements in technology."
3.  **Conclusion**: Summarize your main points and restate your opinion. For example:

    -   "In conclusion, while practical skills are crucial for immediate job readiness, theoretical knowledge is equally important for long-term intellectual growth and innovation. Therefore, universities should strive to balance both aspects to provide a comprehensive education."

### Use Cohesive Devices

1.  **Connect Ideas**: Use linking words and phrases to connect sentences and paragraphs (e.g., furthermore, on the other hand, as a result).

### Vary Your Language

1.  **Range of Vocabulary**: Use a variety of vocabulary and avoid repetition.
2.  **Sentence Structures**: Use different types of sentences (simple, compound, complex) to demonstrate grammatical range.

### Stay on Topic

1.  **Relevance**: Ensure every paragraph directly relates to the question prompt.
2.  **Clarity**: Be clear and concise in your arguments.

### Manage Your Time

1.  **Task 1**: Spend about 20 minutes on Task 1.
2.  **Task 2**: Allocate approximately 40 minutes for Task 2, as it carries more weight in your overall score.

Common Types of Task 2 Questions
--------------------------------

1.  **Opinion (Agree or Disagree)**: "To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?"
2.  **Discussion (Discuss Both Views)**: "Discuss both views and give your opinion."
3.  **Problem-Solution**: "What are the problems and what solutions can be proposed?"
4.  **Advantages-Disadvantages**: "Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?"
5.  **Double Question**: "Why is this happening? Is this a positive or negative development?"
