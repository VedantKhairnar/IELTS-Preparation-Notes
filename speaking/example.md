### Part 1: Introduction and Interview

**Examiner**: Good morning. My name is [Examiner's Name]. Can you tell me your full name, please?

**Candidate**: Good morning. My name is [Candidate's Name].

**Examiner**: Can I see your identification, please?

**Candidate**: Sure, here it is.

**Examiner**: Thank you. Now, in this first part, I'd like to ask you some questions about yourself. Let's talk about where you live. Do you live in a house or an apartment?

**Candidate**: I live in an apartment. It's on the 10th floor of a high-rise building in the city center.

**Examiner**: What do you like about living there?

**Candidate**: I enjoy the convenience of living in the city center. Everything I need, such as shops, restaurants, and public transport, is within walking distance. Also, I have a nice view of the city skyline from my balcony.

**Examiner**: Are there any disadvantages to living in your apartment?

**Candidate**: Yes, one downside is the noise. Being in the city center, it can be quite noisy, especially at night. Additionally, the apartment is a bit small, so there isn't much space for guests or extra storage.

### Part 2: Long Turn

**Examiner**: Now, I'm going to give you a topic. You have one minute to think about what you're going to say. You can make some notes if you wish. Here is a pencil and paper. I'd like you to describe a memorable holiday or vacation you have had.

**Candidate**: [Prepares for 1 minute]

**Examiner**: All right, remember you have 1 to 2 minutes for this. Don't worry if I stop you. Please start speaking now.

**Candidate**: One of the most memorable holidays I've ever had was a trip to Japan last year. I went with a group of friends, and we spent two weeks traveling around the country. We started our journey in Tokyo, where we explored the bustling city life, visited historic temples, and enjoyed the local cuisine. One highlight was visiting the Shibuya Crossing, which is famous for its massive pedestrian scramble.

After Tokyo, we took a bullet train to Kyoto, known for its beautiful gardens and traditional tea houses. In Kyoto, we visited the Fushimi Inari Shrine, which has thousands of red torii gates. It was a truly mesmerizing experience walking through those gates.

We also went to Hiroshima to see the Peace Memorial Park. It was a sobering experience, but it was important for us to understand the history and pay our respects.

Throughout the trip, we stayed in traditional Japanese inns called ryokans, which gave us a taste of authentic Japanese hospitality. We also enjoyed soaking in hot springs, known as onsen, which was incredibly relaxing.

Overall, the combination of modern and traditional experiences made this holiday unforgettable. The friendly people and the amazing food also contributed to making it a trip of a lifetime.

**Examiner**: Thank you. Do you think you would like to visit Japan again in the future?

**Candidate**: Absolutely! There are still many places in Japan I haven't explored, like Hokkaido in the north and Okinawa in the south. I'd love to experience different seasons there, especially the cherry blossom season in spring.

### Part 3: Discussion

**Examiner**: Let's talk about the importance of tourism. How important is tourism in your country?

**Candidate**: Tourism is very important in my country. It significantly contributes to the economy by creating jobs and generating revenue. Many local businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, rely heavily on tourists. Additionally, tourism promotes cultural exchange and understanding, which can have positive social impacts.

**Examiner**: What do you think are the negative impacts of tourism?

**Candidate**: While tourism has many benefits, it can also have negative impacts. For example, popular tourist destinations can suffer from overcrowding, which can lead to environmental degradation and strain on local resources. Additionally, the influx of tourists can sometimes disrupt local communities and traditions. In some cases, it can lead to higher prices for goods and services, making it difficult for locals to afford them.

**Examiner**: How can these negative impacts be mitigated?

**Candidate**: To mitigate the negative impacts of tourism, it's important to promote sustainable tourism practices. This includes encouraging tourists to respect local cultures and environments, limiting the number of visitors to sensitive areas, and investing in infrastructure that can handle large numbers of tourists. Governments and organizations should also educate tourists about responsible behavior and the importance of supporting local businesses and communities.

**Examiner**: Do you think tourists should pay more to visit natural attractions to help preserve them?

**Candidate**: Yes, I think it's reasonable for tourists to pay a bit more to visit natural attractions. The extra funds can be used for conservation efforts, maintenance, and infrastructure improvements. This can help ensure that these sites are preserved for future generations. However, it's important to ensure that the fees are used transparently and effectively for the intended purpose.

**Examiner**: Thank you very much. That is the end of the speaking test.

**Candidate**: Thank you.
